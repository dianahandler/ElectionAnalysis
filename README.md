##Election Audit Summary
This script can be used for a number of things. If this CSV also added a "political party" column, then we could modify the code so as to read back percentages of republican/democrat/other voters per the given counties. Such information could prove useful in future election predictions. This code could also be used to integrate voter information(if relinquished to us) to provide us a more in-depth analysis of which demographics are voting for any said candidate.
